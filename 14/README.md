# Fractals

fractals are geometric patterns in which every smaller part of the structure is similar to the whole. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes, etc. Abstract fractals – such as the Mandelbrot Set – can be generated by a computer calculating a simple equation over and over.


## Self Similarity


In mathematics, a self-similar object is exactly or approximately similar to a part of itself (i.e. the whole has the same shape as one or more of the parts).

## Sierpinski Carpet

The Sierpinski carpet is a plane fractal first described by Wacław Sierpiński in 1916.
The carpet is one generalization of the Cantor set to two dimensions; another is the Cantor dust.

## Sierpinski Triangle

The Sierpinski triangle is a fractal described in 1915 by Waclaw Sierpinski. It is a self similar structure that occurs at different levels of iterations, or magnifications.
The Sierpinski triangle activity illustrates the fundamental principles of fractals – how a pattern can repeat again and again at different scales and how this complex shape can be formed by simple repetition.

1. Start with a triangle.
2. Shrink the triangle to half height, and put a copy in each of the three corners
3. Repeat step 2 for the smaller triangles, again and again, for ever!

# Iteration
like above description you can draw triangles step by step:

<div class="codeAndCanvas" data="SierpinskiTriangleDrawiteration.frag"></div>

another way is tiling triangles and add them together:

# Binary operation

we can achieve sierpinski with binary operation on coordinates.
but before using binary operation you should know concept of Pascal’s Triangle.

## Pascal’s Triangle

Pascal’s Triangle is a number pyramid in which every number is the sum of the two numbers above. 
<p align="center">
<img  src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16706911/76882629-2eebb500-6890-11ea-98f8-bbbb74f02188.gif" >
</p>

Pascal’s Triangle can be continued downwards forever. The Sierpinski pattern will continue, producing bigger and bigger triangles.

## Bitwise AND

A bitwise AND is a binary operation that takes two equal-length binary representations and performs the logical AND operation on each pair of the corresponding bits, which is equivalent to multiplying them.

Bitwise AND of 4-bit integers:
```
0101 (decimal 5) AND 0011 (decimal 3) = 0001 (decimal 1)
```

How it works!?

```

#ifdef GL_ES
precision mediump float;
#endif

uniform vec2 u_resolution;
uniform vec2 u_mouse;
uniform float u_time;
vec4 result;

void main() {
vec2 st = gl_FragCoord.xy/u_resolution.xy;
for(int i =0;i < 5;i++)
st = 3.*fract(st),
result += abs(st.x-1.5)<0.5&&abs(st.y-1.5)<0.5? 1. : 0.;
    gl_FragColor = result;
}
```


## Koch Snowflake


The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve, also known as the Koch island, which was first described by Helge von Koch in 1904.
