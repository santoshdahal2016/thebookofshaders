# Fractals

fractals are geometric patterns in which every smaller part of the structure is similar to the whole. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes, etc. Abstract fractals – such as the Mandelbrot Set – can be generated by a computer calculating a simple equation over and over.


## Self Similarity


In mathematics, a self-similar object is exactly or approximately similar to a part of itself (i.e. the whole has the same shape as one or more of the parts).

## Sierpinski Carpet

The Sierpinski carpet is a plane fractal first described by Wacław Sierpiński in 1916.
The carpet is one generalization of the Cantor set to two dimensions; another is the Cantor dust.

## Sierpinski Triangle

The Sierpinski triangle is a fractal described in 1915 by Waclaw Sierpinski. It is a self similar structure that occurs at different levels of iterations, or magnifications.
The Sierpinski triangle activity illustrates the fundamental principles of fractals – how a pattern can repeat again and again at different scales and how this complex shape can be formed by simple repetition.

1. Start with a triangle.
2. Shrink the triangle to half height, and put a copy in each of the three corners
3. Repeat step 2 for the smaller triangles, again and again, for ever!

# Iteration
like above description you can draw triangles step by step:

<div class="codeAndCanvas" data="SierpinskiTriangleDrawiteration.frag"></div>

another way is tiling triangles and add them together:

# Binary operation

we can achieve sierpinski with binary operation on coordinates.
but before using binary operation you should know concept of Pascal’s Triangle.

## Pascal’s Triangle

Pascal’s Triangle is a number pyramid in which every number is the sum of the two numbers above. 
<p align="center">
<img  src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16706911/76882629-2eebb500-6890-11ea-98f8-bbbb74f02188.gif" >
</p>

Pascal’s Triangle can be continued downwards forever. The Sierpinski pattern will continue, producing bigger and bigger triangles.

## Bitwise AND

A bitwise AND is a binary operation that takes two equal-length binary representations and performs the logical AND operation on each pair of the corresponding bits, which is equivalent to multiplying them.

Bitwise AND of 4-bit integers:
```
0101 (decimal 5) AND 0011 (decimal 3) = 0001 (decimal 1)
```

How it works!?

```

#ifdef GL_ES
precision mediump float;
#endif

uniform vec2 u_resolution;
uniform vec2 u_mouse;
uniform float u_time;
vec4 result;

void main() {
vec2 st = gl_FragCoord.xy/u_resolution.xy;
for(int i =0;i < 5;i++)
st = 3.*fract(st),
result += abs(st.x-1.5)<0.5&&abs(st.y-1.5)<0.5? 1. : 0.;
    gl_FragColor = result;
}
```


## Koch Snowflake


The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve, also known as the Koch island, which was first described by Helge von Koch in 1904.

# Notes
the term fractal was invented by Mandlebrot in an attempt to change how we look at equations at scale. He was upset about the idea of functions and arguments looking smooth when you zoomed into them. He wanted to see definition and results closer to reality. He wanted detail. and OHHH BOIIII, do fractals produce detail!

fractals are dimensional, they are made up of complex numbers ( a real + imaginary number)

When thinking of fractals as self-similar, but this only makes up a section of the world of fractals.

We're going to look at a few famous fractals here and give resources and exercises to play with them.

# Fractal Dimensions
Fractals have dimension, well beyond our traditional understanding of 2d,3d and even 4d dimenions. Most of the time, visually, we're representing our fractals in either 2d or 3d, but they actually have a fractional dimension all their own. This, Dimensionality, it was makes these types of equations....fractals.



# Create an Outline




# Intro

# Definition
Fractals are beautifuly ornate structures created by rather simple pieces of iterated logic. The term Fractal was coined by Benoit Mandlebrot and they are often though of as the images of chaos. Mandlebroat wanted to explore the idea of having more resolution inside equations as you looker closer than the traditional smoother we see in most equations. Fractal forms are something you often seen in nature too such as seashells, mountains, clouds, and even coastlines. Fractals also play a big role in image compression techniques.

# Dimensions
Fractals have dimension beyond the typicaly 2d and 3d dimensions we're used to. In fact, when we visualize Fractals we're usually doing that in 2d using someting called Euler's Forumula. But, all fractals have their own dimensions and that's a very key characteristic for fractals.
