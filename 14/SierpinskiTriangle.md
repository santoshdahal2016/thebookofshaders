The Sierpinski triangle is a fractal described in 1915 by Waclaw Sierpinski. It is a self similar structure that occurs at different levels of iterations, or magnifications.
The Sierpinski triangle activity illustrates the fundamental principles of fractals â€“ how a pattern can repeat again and again at different scales and how this complex shape can be formed by simple repetition.

1. Start with a triangle.
2. Shrink the triangle to half height, and put a copy in each of the three corners
3. Repeat step 2 for the smaller triangles, again and again, for ever!
